# NexEV Website Project Analysis

## Project Overview
NexEV is a React-based website with a modern UI, likely for an electric vehicle company. The project uses React 19 and follows a modular component architecture.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: React 19.1.0
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS 3.3.0
- **Animation**: Framer Motion 12.6.2
- **Testing Libraries**: Jest, React Testing Library
- **Routing**: React Router 6.22.1 (downgraded from v7 to ensure compatibility)

## Project Structure
- **src/components/**: Reusable UI components
  - Header, Footer, Cursor, VideoBackground
- **src/sections/**: Page sections for the website
  - Hero, About, Benefits, Contact, FAQ, Features, HowWeWork, Innovation, Portfolio, Results, Solutions, Technology, Testimonial
- **src/constants/**: Configuration and constant values
- **src/assets/**: Static assets like images

## UI/UX Approach
- Dark theme with a navy/blue color scheme (based on tailwind config)
- Video background with gradient overlays
- Custom cursor implementation
- Animation using Framer Motion

## Routing
- Main page with multiple sections
- Separate Contact page route

## Notable Features
- Video background with opacity and speed controls
- Custom cursor implementation
- Radial gradient and overlay effects for UI
- Comprehensive section structure indicating a full-featured marketing/corporate site

## Potential Enhancement Areas
- Mobile responsiveness confirmation needed
- SEO implementation status unknown
- Performance optimization for video background
- State management approach unclear (may use React context or other libraries)
- Authentication/user management doesn't appear implemented

## Development Workflow
- Uses standard React Scripts commands for development
- TailwindCSS for styling with custom color configuration 

## Resolved Issues
- Fixed missing dependency: installed react-router-dom package which was referenced in code but not included in package.json
- Fixed React Router version compatibility: downgraded from v7.5.1 to v6.22.1 to match imports used in the codebase (BrowserRouter, Routes, Route, Link)
- Installed react-router package to ensure complete routing functionality
